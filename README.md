Test your analytics skills by predicting which New York Times blog articles will be the most popular

What makes online news articles popular?

Newspapers and online news aggregators like Google News need to understand which news articles will be the most popular, so that they can prioritize the order in which stories appear. In this competition, you will predict the popularity of a set of New York Times blog articles from the time period September 2014-December 2014.

Many blog articles are published each day, and the New York Times has to decide which articles should be featured. In this competition, we challenge you to develop an analytics model that will help the New York Times understand the features of a blog post that make it popular.
